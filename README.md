# REAPER Data Dir

Primarily, this repository is for me to back up my REAPER data directory. Some
of these things take a lot of work to create and others may benefit from the
files so I decided to publish publicly.

If you know how to use git well then I don't need to explain how to use this
repository. If you _don't_ know how to use git well then ignore git and browse
the directories directly and click to view the raw files and download or copy
them to your machine.

# MIDI Note Names

The `./MIDINoteNames` directory contains the MIDI mappings for various virtual
instruments that I use. I don't create a lot of these or edit them often but
will update when I do.
